# Customer Segmentation With RFM and Clustering techniques

Customer segmentation is a crucial aspect of business strategy, enabling companies to tailor their offerings and marketing efforts to specific customer groups. This project leverages the power of data-driven techniques, including the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value) approach and unsupervised learning models such as K-Means, DBSCAN, and agglomerative clustering, to perform customer segmentation.

**RFM Analysis**

RFM analysis is a powerful technique used by data scientists and marketing professionals to understand and segment customers based on their buying behavior. By analyzing three key metrics—recency, frequency, and monetary value—businesses can gain valuable insights into customer engagement, loyalty, and overall value.

→ Recency:→ Measures the time elapsed since a customer's last purchase, indicating how recently they have interacted with the business.
→ Frequency:→ Indicates how often a customer makes purchases, providing insights into their level of engagement and loyalty.
→ Monetary value:=→ Represents the total amount a customer has spent, reflecting their overall value to the business.

By leveraging RFM analysis, businesses can gain a deeper understanding of their customer base and make informed decisions to optimize their marketing efforts, enhance customer relationships, and drive growth.

By analyzing customer behavior and identifying distinct segments, businesses can:

→ Understand the unique needs and preferences of each customer group.
→ Personalize marketing campaigns and product offerings to improve customer engagement and satisfaction.
→ Optimize resource allocation by focusing on high-value customer segments.
→ Identify potential churn risks and develop strategies to retain valuable customers.

This project demonstrates the application of these powerful techniques to real-world customer data, providing insights that can help businesses enhance their customer segmentation strategies and drive growth.
